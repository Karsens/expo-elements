   * #idea: make an "app" ui that shows people as apps, and all actions look like apps too:
   *
   * - meeting -> meeting icon
   * - call-> call icon
   * - text-> sms app icon (legally, this is borderline)
   * - more -> contact app icon
   *
   * This gives the extra intuitive possibility to add/drag&drop/delete those inner apps (which are actions).
   * If I do something like this, I have much more possibilities. For example, every group could be an app too, which can be expanded. In fact, that's a great idea! Let's start with that. Just use a modal instead of the crazy animation, at first. I could make the groups thing a tab instead of an icon in the header. This removes two icons from the header. Great!

   * This is so intuitive that apple will be very interested in buying Dunbar once it gets big. Therefore, it may not be the right strategy. It could be, but I'd have to think about it.
